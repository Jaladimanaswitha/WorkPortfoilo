# Farmer Customer Connect
## About the project

The Farmer Customer Connect is a web application and an E-Commerce website which can be used by both farmers and customers to buy and sell vegetables, dairy products, fruits etc. In this Web application farmers can register themselves and sell their produce at a suitable price. Customers can also buy various vegetables, dairy products, and fruits from their home for a nominal price. This Web application connects both farmer’s and customer’s digitally making it easier for farmers to sell their products at ease without any intermediate buyers. This Web application mainly aims to remove the middlemen so that the farmer’s can sell their products at a suitable price.
