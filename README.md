# Farmer Customer Connect
## About the project:

In the project application, a farmer has to sign up using the application so that he/she can log in and try updating the product and can sell them. Then he/she needs to login into the application so that they can add/update the product details. Moreover a farmer must be able to update his/her profile so that customers can get updated details
Next farmer must see all the orders that the customers placed, soon after he/she logs in, so that he/she can accept or reject the orders. Furthermore, a farmer must be able to see all the products that he/she has added, so that they can update the quantity or the price if required. On top of that, a farmer must be able to add product details along with the deliverable locations such as pin codes so that the customers can place orders.
Similarly, a customer has to register in the application so that he/she can log in and check for products. Then he/she needs to log in to the application using the registered details so that they can search and buy the products needed.
Next customer has to search for products he/she needs so that they can place orders. Then they must be able to see the details of the product like price, expected delivery date, the farming methods etc so that I can order them. Having said that, they should be able to add the items to the cart so that they can order them. Furthermore, customers must be able to update the address/location details at the time of placing an order so that the delivery person stays informed.

## Problem facing till now:
We had a little problem with the implementation of CSS but we completed the CSS by applying bootstrap.
We faced a few problems related to posting and fetching data to and from the database, but we could solve the issues by going through various online resources.
## Technologies that we are learning:
* Frontend:
React
* Backend:
Node, Express and Mongodb
* Testing tool:
Jest
* Code Versioning Systems:
Git and GitHub


## Learnings:
* Sprint 1: Learnings
During Sprint 1, we learnt about scrum processes and agile methodology. Also, we came to know about the technologies (MERN - MongoDB, Express, React JS and Node JS) that have to be used to complete the project. After that we learnt how to create and use Git repositories and branches. During the last day of the Sprint, we started to create a database and created a sample database to know about how databases work.
* Sprint 2: Learnings
During Sprint 2, we were split into two teams and my team was given a task of creating screens(UI - User Interface) and database tables. After going through various examples of database tables we created a few suitable database tables along with the screens. After creating the screens and database tables we started working on the navbar (navigation bar) and completed it by the end of Sprint 2.
* Sprint 3: Learnings
During Sprint 3, my team started working on farmers profile page where a user with type farmer will be able to edit his/her information and update it in the database without creating a new field in the database. 

* Sprint 4:Learnings
During Sprint 4, my team started working on the farmers product adding page where a user with type farmer will be able to add and edit his/her information regarding the products and update it in the database. These details will be showcased in the website and can be edited or deleted by the farmer along with adding new products.
